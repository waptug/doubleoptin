This is a double opt in email delivery system

Used to faciliate the collection of an email address

in exchange for a HVC .zip file containing a configurable number of PLR .txt files

the files are randomly selected from a source folder that can be nested 

Files will be randomly picked from the available files ending in .txt

System will then pick 1 random file image from a folder that can be nested as well


Barebones system for running on shared hosting systems

which have an smtp server available that will allow outbound

email to be sent from a existing email account on the server.

Based on ther LAMP stack
