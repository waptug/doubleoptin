                <p>PLR products are literally one of the best ways to make money online right now or whether you're selling physical products just want to sell digital products or you have an affiliate offer and you want to incentivize people to buy from your affiliate link. In today's video, I'll be sharing with you the three absolute best PLR companies that you should be buying from.</p>

                <p>Now guys, those of you tuning in to the e-commerce empire builders for the very first time, let me give you a huge, huge, huge warm welcome. My name is Peter Prue, and every single Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we release new content here on the channel, so if you like this sort of stuff, make sure to hit that subscribe button, notification bell, and of course, hit that like button. All those things are completely free, and it helps us reach more people. But guys, today what we're talking about is PLR products. If you don't know what a PLR product is, it stands for private label rights. Essentially, in a nutshell, you can purchase a PLR from a website, you get the rights to use that product, that ebook, that course however you see fit, right? You are the owner of it. Now, you can resell it, you can give it away for free to build your list. I love PLRs because they are so versatile, and you can literally do so many cool things with them. You can incentivize people to purchase your physical product by bundling a bunch of PLR products with it. You can just sell PLR products for a profit. You can give them away for free to build up your email list, and then you could sell them stuff on the back end or maybe you're an affiliate marketer, and you like promoting other people's stuff, right? Adding in some PLR products to incentivize people to buy from your affiliate link, right? The list is absolutely endless, right? Digital products, especially PLRs, if you're not leveraging them, you're literally just saying you don't like money because it's literally so simple to use, it costs you a few bucks to purchase them, and you get hundreds of articles and ready-to-use stuff that you can literally do whatever you want with, okay? So today, all hype aside, let's go over to the shoulder right now, guys, let me show you guys my three favorite places to purchase PLR products from.</p>
                
                <p>The first one, guys, I've always mentioned this one is called the PLR store.com. Guys, they have an absolute massive database of products that you can actually search. My favorite thing to do is whatever your niche is, whatever it might be, is literally just type it in into the top. So if it's like fitness, right? You could just type in fitness. It takes a little few seconds to load, but let's click it, and you'll see that your fitness products are right here, ready to use. For example, fitness nutrition PLR articles, let's click into it, and right here, you could see what they're actually charging for it and it comes with all of these articles, right? You see weight gain, are carbs the culprit, water the secret to your nutrition plan, and just get a little bit of an explanation of what this actual PLR includes.</p>
                
                <p>Now here's the thing, the big downside to the PLR store is that it's just going to come as plain Jane text files, and not that that's a bad thing, but you can't just sell somebody a text file, right? Picture if you just bought a digital product or something, and they just send you like ten text files, right? Like it's like, what? Because it's one thing to just information, you need to package that information in an easily digestible way and in a high perceived value way, right? That's really important. You can hire somebody on Fiverr, you can do it on Google slides for yourself, but you don't want to just throw a text file at your customer, right? It's just not going to look pretty for them. So the PLR store is usually a good place to get some articles and things like that, but you really want some pre-made stuff, which leads me to the next one which is our company called empireplr.com that we've recently just launched. These are PLRs that are already done and ready. You have two options here, so for example, when you go to empireplr.com, you can see some of the latest stuff that we've added in here, but when you go to the about us, there's two real differences, and this is why I wanted to share this with you guys is you have ready to use info products, that means they're ready to go. You just put your name on it, and you can sell them. You don't have to make a whole bunch of tweaks or edits to it at all. That means they're ready to use, ready to sell. Then you have unrestricted article packs. Now these article packs are essentially text files, right? They are, you're going to change them up, so depending on what your needs are, right? You can purchase the ready to use stuff that's ready to go, just buy it and start selling it, right? Or you can get the article packs that if you want to change it up or make tweaks or edits, you can do that as well, okay? Now we organize this very cleanly just under PLR store right here. If you just go to empireplr.com, you'll see that, and everything is categorized, or you have indoor hobbies, outdoor hobbies, sports, wellness, fashion, relationship, pets, and we're adding so much stuff in here each and every single day, guys. So by the time you're watching, there's probably way more in here. But for example, if we just go to pets right here and click, you know, for example, cat, right? You'll see that you can get 123 cat articles, right? Look, this is literally every single article in existence in this PLR space, right? For 4.99, now you can see all of these articles in here, right? Like all of them are in here, but they're all text files, right? They're all text files that you'll need to then edit or change up or tweak yourself, right? And if that's what you want to do, that's perfectly fine. You have all those articles ready to go, and each of these can be sold on their own, which is insane. But if you want the stuff that's ready to sell, right? For example, let's keep this, you know, keeping your indoor cat happy, right? Right here, this is already done. This ebook is already done. We tweaked it; we edited it. All you have to do is just put in your business name or whatever, and you can start selling it. It's already changed up. It already has a lot of high perceived value. That's why it's a little bit more expensive because our team here obviously has to actually design these things, right? But you have those two options, you see what I'm saying? You have those two options to either choose something that's already ready to sell or if you just want the articles that you can then change up for however you see fit for whatever your business needs are, okay? So that's the second place you guys want to go is empireplr.com where you can learn more about how you can purchase these ready-to-use PLR products.</p>
                
                <p>Now, my third place, my third favorite place to purchase PLR products on is plrproducts.com. Okay, they have a massive database of PLR products that you can choose from. Again, similar to the PLR store, this place has a lot of business side, you know, we don't really have a lot on empire PLR of like PLRs on like crypto or PLRs on making money. In the future, we'll add that right now. We're really just focused on passion, hobbies, niches, things that we actually sell, but you can actually go and use plrproducts.com if you want to, depending on what your niche is. Let's say it's like cryptocurrency, right? You sell cryptocurrency stuff. Like you could purchase a cryptocurrency course here for 9.99, put yourself as the author, and boom, you're in business. Now, again, the ethics of this, I'm not here to judge, so you have to make that own decision for yourself. I'm always in the frame of mind; if you sell stuff that you yourself use, sell stuff that you yourself believe in, that's how you build a real business. But you could see here, like an ebook, you could purchase this ebook here for 9.99 in the cryptocurrency niche, and they have a lot of business stuff. They have here like online businesses, offline businesses, membership sites, making money online, right? And these are good ways, depending on what you're in, maybe you can add some of this kind of stuff in, and that is plrproducts.com.</p>
                
                <p>Guys, I would love to hear from you in the comment section, any kind of PLR websites that you like. I always like having a good Rolodex of places to purchase these PLR products on because they're so versatile and absolutely so easy to use. Let me know down below in the comment section. Also, guys, we have a ton of free resources available for you down below in the description of today's video. You'll also be able to check out empireplr.com down there as well.
